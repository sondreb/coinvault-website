            <h2>A simple and easy crypto wallet accessible everywhere</h2>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/screenshot.png">

                CoinVault is a Non-Custodial HD wallet for coins based on the Bitcoin protocol, with support for
                Stratis (STRAX) and Cirrus (CRC). CoinVault also keeps your identities and keys safe, while allowing you
                to communicate securely and authenticate with web apps.
            </p>
            <p>CoinVault makes it simple & safe for users to interact with the Stratis blockchain.</p>
            <p>
                CoinVault supports management of multiple wallets and accounts, allowing users the total freedom of
                how they want to manage their assets.
            </p>
            <h3>CoinVault benefits</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- <img class="drawing-right" src="assets/screenshot-wallet-management.png"> -->
                CoinVault is an extension that you install on your web browser, which is <strong>faster and
                    easier</strong> than downloading large software, which is often the case when interacting
                with blockchains.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <strong>less than a minute</strong>, you can install CoinVault and be ready to receive coins, tokens,
                create identities and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are no verification of your identity required to use CoinVault, it is completely Non-Custodial,
                meaning that all your keys are stored locally on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can hold and manage assets across multiple blockchains from the same wallet and UI, making it much
                easier to manage and get an overview of your assets.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposal: Stratis and Cirrus Wallet</h3>
            <p>
                We make a bid to the Stratis Decentralized Accelerator for funding to develop a non-custodial wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wallet will allow users to store, send, receive, setup coldstaking, create tokens, swap tokens,
                vote on proposal and generally interact with smart contracts on top of the Stratis mainchain and
                sidechains.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will prioritize functionality based upon what we confidently will be able to deliver, and we share
                our plans for additional functionality that we will develop dependent on available funding and requests
                from the community and users.

                What we will deliver:

            <ul>
                <li>HD wallet, one key all coins</li>
                <li>Multiple Wallet, Multiple Account management</li>

            <h2>Technical proposal</h2>

            <p>
                We propose to build a wallet UI for the Stratis network, however to interact with the Stratis and Cirrus
                blockchains
                there need to be a rich and powerful blockchain indexers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our work will involve not just building the extension UI but also explorers to allow searching and querying
                blockchain data.
            </p>

            <strong>Wallet</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_programmer_imem.svg">
                Use HD technology to generate security phrase (mnemonic) to easy backup and recover your wallet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hold, send, and receive STRAX and CRC in one place.
            </p>

            <strong>Smart Contracts</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Making smart contract on Cirrus accessible without running a fullnode:
            <ul>
                <li>Issue and store tokens on Cirrus.</li>
                <li>Interact with the Opdex protocol to swap token issued on Cirrus.</li>
                <li>Enable master nodes to vote on SDA proposals.</li>
                <li>Create and store NFTs. (pending NFT contracts are available)</li>
                <li>Coldstaking, stake Strax safely with external staking pools</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <strong>Indexer</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Blockcore already has an indexer for Stratis we will improve it and also adapt it to Cirrus and create
                APIs to interact with
                smart contracts on Cirrus.
            </p>

            <strong>Explorer</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Blockcore Explorer will be extended to Stratis and Cirrus, users will be able to query to blockchain for
                information.

            <p>
                <strong>Development:</strong> Salaries for the developers and product manager. Software and tooling
                licenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cloud & Services:</strong> To run and host indexers and explorers, we will be using an
                hybrid-cloud solution
                where we run some servers on-premises and some servers in the cloud. This is to optimize cost spending
                and high availability of the services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Marketing:</strong> As CoinVault is an consumer product, we expect to be spending some of the
                funding for advertisement and marketing of the extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Legal:</strong> While CoinVault is an Non-Custodial wallet, our users are consumers and we'll
                need some legal support to ensure our end user license agreements and other contracts and business
                agreements with third parties are legally sound and good.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Business Operations:</strong> We expect a fairly low budget for business operations, as the
                business manager also has a role as developer and will be hands-on with the team at all times. We
                expected business operations to grow in the future as CoinVault popularity and usage increase.

            <h2>Existing Development</h2>

            <p>
                This proposal is to further develop and extend an existing browser extension that Blockcore has built
                for decentralized identifier (and more). This means some of the functionality is already present in the
                software and deliveries based on the proposal will begin immediately if and when the proposal is
                approved.
            </p>

            <h2>Future income potential</h2>

            <p>
                CoinVault is an end-user software product that has potential for large user-base, but direct income from
                those users are not a viable option. We want to avoid making CoinVault an paid user service.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will continuously investigate potential income potentials with CoinVault. Some potential financial
                agreements can be made with token and coin swapping services, allowing CoinVault team to receive
                kick-back payment on swaps.
            </p>
            <p>Another potential revenue source could be providing users with hosting for their digital assets
                (verifiable credentials, NFTs).</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <p>Q: What is Softchains?</p>

            <p>A: Softchains Ltd is an UK-based company that sponsors and supports Blockcore.</p>

            <p>
                Softchains will be responsible for contracts, agreements, employments, salaries and all other business
                related needs for the wallet development team.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Q: What is Blockcore?</p>

            <p>A: Blockcore is a collection of voluntary individuals joined together to build and maintain, blockchain
                and decentralized open source projects.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Q: Alternatives?</p>

            <p>A: <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">Metamask</a> is the most widely used browser extension
                wallet, built for Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies
                and tokens.
            </p>

            <p><a href="https://phantom.app/" target="_blank">Phantom</a> is another browser extension wallet, built for
                Solana blockchain cryptocurrencies
                and tokens.
            </p>

            <p>CoinVault will deliver similar functionality to Metamask and Phantom, but for Bitcoin-based blockchains,
                such as Stratis.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Q: Open source?</p>

            <p>A: CoinVault will be licensed as open source with the MIT license. In contrast with Metamask, which has
                an non-commercial license and Phantom, which is closed source. We believe open source will allow more
                innovation, than doing either commercial license or closed source.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Q: Fork or original?</p>

            <p>A: CoinVault is entirely based upon original source code, and is not a fork of any existing code base.
            </p>

            <p>The Explorer is not a fork and original code base. It is an existing offering from Blockcore that we
                will enhance with additional functionality.</p>

            <p>The Indexer is based upon a fork of existing indexing software, built by Dan Gershony and others. It has
                been a part of the Blockcore offering since the beginning.</p>
